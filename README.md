This is my code playground.
Any interesting problem I solve I will drop some code here.

At this time there is code for a string decode function.
The function expects a string in form k[encodedstring] where k is always a natural number
and everything between the brackets is text and can be decoded as well, recursively.
Example
	ba2[na] = banana
	3[ g2[o]d  morning] =  good morning good morning good morning
